Certainly! Here's a detailed breakdown of where you can use each color in different components of your blood donation web app:

### Color Usage Guide

1. **Primary Color (Red - #B30000)**:

   - **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Use red for buttons that prompt immediate action, such as "Donate Now" or "Emergency Assistance".
   - **Alerts and Notifications**: Highlight urgent messages or alerts using red to draw attention.
   - **Important Headers**: Use red sparingly for headers or titles that need to stand out, such as section titles or announcements.

2. **Secondary Color (White - #FFFFFF)**:

   - **Background**: Use white as the background color for the entire website to create a clean and professional look.
   - **Text**: Use black or dark gray text on a white background for optimal readability.
   - **Icons and Logos**: Use white or transparent backgrounds for icons and logos to blend seamlessly with the overall design.

3. **Accent Color (Light Blue - #3498DB)**:

   - **Navbar**: Use light blue for navbar backgrounds or hover effects to indicate interactive elements.
   - **Buttons**: Use light blue for secondary buttons or links within the app that are less urgent than primary actions.
   - **Links**: Style hyperlinks with light blue to distinguish them from regular text and improve accessibility.

4. **Supporting Color (Light Gray - #CCCCCC)**:

   - **Borders and Dividers**: Use light gray for borders between sections, dividers within content areas, or to separate different elements on the page.
   - **Background Accents**: Use light gray as a subtle background color for modals, tooltips, or less prominent elements that need differentiation.
